`gradle jar` on a terminal. Gradle will automatically download all dependencies needed to compile your jar file,
which will be stored in the build/libs folder.

Make sure to edit the main class attribute the build.gradle file, you'll need to change it in order to obtain
a working jar file.

# Important Files
## build.gradle / gradle.properties
This is the gradle configuration file. Modify this file to add dependencies to your project. In
 general you should only modify the depedencies section of this file, however there are a few
  modification you will need to make when you begin the project
  
  - `mainClassName`
    - Modifiy this variable to point to your main class. By default it is `edu.wpi.teamname.Main
    `, but once you update your teamname package to your team letter you will need to update this
     path.
